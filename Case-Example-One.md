# TOGAF 10 ADM Practical Examples for Solution Architects

---

## Example 1: Digital Banking Platform Modernization

### Phase Context
**ADM Phase A: Architecture Vision**

### Example Scenario
A regional bank with $50B in assets needs to modernize its core banking platform to compete with digital-first competitors. Current challenges include: 30-year-old COBOL mainframe, 6-month feature delivery cycles, inability to offer real-time services, and compliance with new open banking regulations.

### Principles Applied
- **Business Continuity**: Ensure no disruption to critical banking operations during transformation
- **Data Security and Privacy**: Maintain PCI-DSS and SOX compliance throughout modernization  
- **Interoperability**: Enable integration with fintech partners and regulatory reporting systems
- **Service Orientation**: Design for API-first, cloud-native architecture

### Practical Deliverables

#### Architecture Vision Document
```
Executive Summary:
Transform legacy core banking system to cloud-native, API-first platform enabling:
- Real-time payment processing and account updates
- Open banking API compliance (PSD2/UK Open Banking)
- 10x faster feature delivery (6 months → 3 weeks)
- 40% reduction in operational costs over 3 years

Business Drivers:
├── Regulatory Compliance: Open Banking APIs by Q2 2025
├── Competitive Pressure: Real-time payments, instant lending decisions
├── Cost Reduction: Mainframe maintenance costs increasing 15% annually
└── Innovation Speed: Enable fintech partnerships and embedded finance

Success Metrics:
├── Technical: 99.95% uptime, <200ms API response times
├── Business: 25% increase in digital engagement, 50% faster loan approvals
├── Financial: $10M annual savings, ROI achieved by Year 2
└── Regulatory: 100% compliance with open banking standards
```

#### Stakeholder Map
```
Primary Stakeholders:
├── CEO: Business transformation, competitive positioning
├── CTO: Technology strategy, risk management
├── Chief Risk Officer: Regulatory compliance, operational risk
├── Head of Digital: Customer experience, digital channels
└── Head of Operations: Service continuity, process efficiency

Secondary Stakeholders:
├── Regulators: Compliance requirements, reporting standards
├── Customers: Service availability, new digital features
├── Fintech Partners: Integration capabilities, API reliability
└── IT Operations: System stability, performance monitoring
```

### Solution Architect's Role
- **Lead Architecture Vision workshops** with C-level executives to align on business outcomes
- **Facilitate stakeholder analysis** to identify concerns, requirements, and success criteria
- **Create and present business case** connecting technical transformation to business value
- **Define high-level architecture principles** that will guide detailed design decisions
- **Establish governance framework** for architecture decisions throughout the program

### Key Practices
- **Business-First Communication**: Present technical concepts in business value terms (revenue impact, cost savings, risk reduction)
- **Risk-Based Planning**: Identify critical dependencies and failure points early in the vision
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensure all key stakeholders understand and commit to the transformation scope
- **Constraint Documentation**: Clearly articulate what will and won't change during transformation
- **Success Criteria Definition**: Establish measurable outcomes that demonstrate architecture success

### Reflection Questions
- How would you communicate the 3-year ROI to skeptical board members who are risk-averse about core banking changes?
- What would convince the Chief Risk Officer that cloud-native architecture is more secure than the current mainframe?
- How do you balance innovation speed with the bank's culture of stability and risk management?
